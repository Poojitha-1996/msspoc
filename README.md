# msspoc

This is to conduct a Proof of Concept (PoC) for MSS Stage 2. This involves validating the technical feasibility, performance, and scalability of the MSS solution in the target state. The PoC will help identify any potential issues and ensure that the solution meets the required standards before full-scale implementation
